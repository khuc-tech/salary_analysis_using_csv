# Salary Analysis Project (using csv file)

This is my first Python project, built during my 12th standard.  
It is a **Salary Survey Program** that reads country-wise salary data from a CSV file and allows basic data analysis, manipulation, and visualization using Python libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

It may contain basic coding practices that I have since improved upon.
